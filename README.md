# Time-Based-Random-UUID

ðŸ†” Mix of a time-based and a randomly generated UUID - Mix of v1 and v4

## Information

This is an alternative version of a randomly generated UUID, using both the timestamp and pseudo-random bytes.

Maybe I'm wrong about all that but I thought mixing the UUID v1 and v4 methods would make the generated UUID more secure, as it ensures a zero-chance of collision of a single computer and a -really- low chance of collision on multiple computers (because of both probability and time).

The UUID contains 62 randomly generated bits, so there is 2^62 different outcomes for that part of the generated UUID, which means you'd start geeting colisions after about 2^31 generations. That being said, that would only happen if you were able to generate that many UUIDs within 100 nanosecond to 1 microsecond (because the gettimeofday() function used here returns a microsecond-precise timestamp).

This generated UUID format is `oooooooo-oooo-Mooo-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`, it concatenates:
- `o`: The current timestamp (60 bits) (time_low, time_mid, time_high)
- `M`: The version (4 bits)
- `N`: The variant (2 bits)
- `x`: Pseudo-random values (62 bits)
